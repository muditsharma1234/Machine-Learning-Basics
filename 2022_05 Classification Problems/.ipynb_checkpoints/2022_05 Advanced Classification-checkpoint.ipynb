Now logistic regression is a kind of parametric model we can also leverage non-parametric models to solve for classification problems. Let us try to understand the difference between Parametric and Non-Parametric models. \n",

    "- Non Parametric Models: These models do no assume anything about the underlying data as far as distributions are concerned. They try to memorize the train data and make the predictions based on the understanding of the underlying training dataset. "
